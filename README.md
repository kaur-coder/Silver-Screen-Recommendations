Project Description

Silver Screen Recommendation is a system that seeks to predict or filter 

preferences of movies according to the userâ€™s choices. Recommendation systems 

are employed across various domains such as films, music, news, literature, 

academic papers, search requests, social tags, and general products. 

They encompass straightforward algorithms designed to present users with the 

most pertinent information by identifying patterns within a dataset. These 

algorithms assess items and present users with those they are likely to rate 

positively. An example of recommendation in action is when you visit any 

shopping websites like Amazon and you notice that some items are being 

recommended to you or when Netflix recommends certain movies to you.

based on the user's selections.
